-- Step 1: Take a snapshot of the data before making changes
SELECT * FROM flexibility_test WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Step 2: Make a change (this will persist because it's not wrapped in a transaction)
UPDATE flexibility_test SET age = 35 WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Step 3: Verify the change
SELECT * FROM flexibility_test WHERE name = 'Alice'; -- Age should now be 35

-- Step 4: Restore the original value to maintain integrity for future tests
UPDATE flexibility_test SET age = 30 WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Step 5: Confirm the data is restored
SELECT * FROM flexibility_test WHERE name = 'Alice'; -- Age should now be back to 30
